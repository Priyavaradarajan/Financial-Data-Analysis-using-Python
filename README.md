# Financial-Data-Analysis-using-Python

The main goal of the project is to prepare a DataMart from financial banking data sets that 
can be used for predictive analysis to improve the bankâ€™s customer service or describe the 
different kind of clients the bank has. In addition to the data mart creation, some 
exploratory and descriptive visualizations are done to provide some useful insights on the 
clients. 

The data availed for the financial analysis is from a bank that offers services to private 
clients. Services include managing accounts, offering loans, etc. With the development of the 
bank, there is a need for them to better understand their clients to improve their services. 
The data mart and the visualisation analysis done in this project can help the bank to 
improve decision making also proposing new services to clients

Key focus on the analysis is to draw a user picture or 360-degree view of the customer based 
on all available data i.e. who is a good client and what additional services he can be provided 
with and who are bad clients to watch carefully to minimize the bank loses. 

Additional information on the code and the actual visualizations are present in this repository
